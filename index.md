Namaste
*I bow down (Namah) to you (te) with respect*,

I welcome you to my Webpage/ Blog. I have made this page to speak my heart out and leave a digital trail of few things I would have thought of.
Knowledge is infinite, so come, let me give you a little taste of my brain.

Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu
*Let all people/ worlds (Lokah) in the whole universe (samastah) live (bhavantu) peacefully and happily (sukhino) *
Tanoy 'n0tty' Bose

Navigation in this site is pretty simple.
If you want to know about me, it is but obvious in the about section. This section might also include information 
of friends that have contributed to my blog.
Next, the random section. Like the name suggests, it will be me voicing my opinion on random topics. Few of them include Gaming, Politics, Physics, 
Geeky stuff or anything I feel interested in randomly.
Then we have the Hacking. Something which I do professionally. Mostly will have the most contribution from me.
Sanatana Dharma. A spiritual philosophy. A way of life. This will be for people who want to understand ones spiritual self.
Finally my research. This might have the most interesting contents of all.
